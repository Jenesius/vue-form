# Input
The main forms are the data entry field. At this time will be considered in detail
how `<InputField/>` works and how to implement your own input yourself.

## Initialization
To bind to a form, the usual *useInputState* method call is used:
```ts
import {useInputState} from "jenesius-vue-form"
const name = "username" // Or any input name
const {state, input} = useInputState(name)
```
That's all, this function will connect the input mole with the form model. You just need to connect it with
your view and that's it.

Let's create a simple analogue for the "text" field.
```vue
<!-- new-input.vue -->
<template>
    <input
        type = "text"
        :value = "state.value"
        @input = "input.change($event.target.value)"
        :disabled = "state.disabled"
    />
</template>
<script setup>
    import {useInputState} from "jenesius-vue-form"
    const props = defineProps();
    const {state, input} = useInputState(props.name)
</script>
```
As you can see from the example, *state* is a reactive object and stores the following data:
- **value** Any value that is stored in the form's data model.
- **disabled** Boolean variable indicating whether the field is disabled.
- **errors** Array of test errors after validation passed.
  On the other hand, *input* provides functionality for working with the data model:
- **change** Changes field values.
- **validate** Checks the field for validity. Returns an array of text errors. In case when
  the field is valid - will return an empty array.

After creating this input, you can safely use it with the form:
```vue
<new-input name = "login" />
    
<script setup>
    const form = new Form();
</script>
```
In the current example, the field will be associated with and managed by the form's data model.

## Reusing an InputField

This method gives you complete control over the situation, however, when developing your own
fields partially rely on neither `<InputField/>`.

Creating more different input fields will create confusion in your code. For this
[extension mechanism](configuration.md#inputtypes) of standard input fields was implemented.

Let's go back to our `new-input.vue` and rewrite it for better usability:
```vue
<!-- new-input.vue -->
<template>
    <input
        type = "text"
        :value = "modelValue"
        @input = "$emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)"
        :disabled = "disabled"
        :class = "{ 'input-text_error': errors.length !== 0 }"
    />
</template>
<script >
    export default {
        props: {
            errors: [],
            modelValue: '',
            disabled: Boolean
        }
    }
</script>
```
In this case, we do not use hooks and additional functions. It will do everything for us
*InputField*. It may seem that this example does not give us the opportunity to set our own
values, because it will be hidden behind the parent input. This is not true:

**All** props passed to the InputField will also be passed to your component.

Now it remains to add it to the configuration:
```ts
import {config} from "jenesius-vue-form";
import NewInput from "./new-input.vue";
config({
    inputTypes: {
        new: NewInput, // New Input
    }
})
```
And feel free to use it in your code:
```vue
<template>
    <input-field type = "new"/>
</template>
```
