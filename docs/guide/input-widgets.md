# Widgets
For rapid form development, access to a set of components
(input fields) that are automatically connected to the form.
```html
// import {InputField} from "jenesius-vue-form"
<input-field :type = "type" />
```
For work, fields for entering the following type were developed:
- [Text](#text)
- [Select](#select)
- [Password](#password)
- [Checkbox](#checkbox)
- [Switch](#switch)
- [Radio](#radio)
- [Tel](#tel)
- [Range](#range)
- [Number](#number)
- Date (in developing)
- Color (in developing, low-priority)
- File (in developing, low-priority)
- Email (in developing, low-priority)

## Text
The usual field for entering textual information.
```html
<input-field :type = "text" />
```

<WidgetExampleInputText/>

By the way, the *:type* parameter in the case of the Text field can be omitted.

## Select

Represents an element that allows you to select a value from the provided ones.

<WidgetExampleInputSelect/>

Passed parameters:
- **options** A set of enumerated dimensions. There are two types of transfer
possible:
As Object:
```json
{
	"green": "Green color",
    "red"  : "Red color"
}
```
Like Array:
```ts
[
	{ title: 'Green color', value: 'green' },
	{ title: 'Red color', value: 'red' }
]
```
When passed as an object, the value will always be of type *string*. When
*Array* value type can be any.

## Password

```html
<input-field type = "password" />

(ticked) when activated, like you might see in an official government paper form.
